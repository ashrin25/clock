            <h2>Missile Man Of India </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and 
       statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in 
       Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist 
       and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space 
       Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile 
       development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
       ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and 
       political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 
       1974.
